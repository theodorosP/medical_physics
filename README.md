# medical_Physics_library
Introducing a simple library for manipulating artificial data, generated by GEANT4. This simple library was written in order to help UCF students who are working with Dr Chris Velissaris for simple medical physics projects. I will be updating the library according to students demands.

# Requirements

python (> 3.7 but it should work with any 3.x version)

matplotlib ( > 3.15, but it should work with any version )


# Instalation 

Step 1:

git clone https://github.com/theodorosP/medical_physics_library.git

Step 2: Add the path to dlePy folder to $PYTHONPATH environment. There are many ways to accomplish this. Here is an example.

export PYTHONPATH=Path_to_medical_physics_library:$PYTHONPATH
